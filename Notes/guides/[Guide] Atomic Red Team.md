# Overview

Atomic Red Team is an open-source project designed to test detection and response capabilities. It provides a small library of self-contained test ("atomics") that map directly to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. 

By using a selection of tests (T Codes), you choose the specific adversary technique you want to simulate. The tests are provided through the command-line. After executing the tests, you can review the logs and alerts generated by your security tools.

# Commands
