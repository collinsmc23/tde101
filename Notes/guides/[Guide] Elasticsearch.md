Fleet server allows you to deploy, manage, and maintain your Elastic agents as they are deployed to various hosts. 

Fleet server operates and listens on port `8220` by default. 

The communication path between a system with an Elastic agent, Fleet server, and ELK Tenant uses the following by default:

`Host ---> Fleet-Server:8220 --> Elasticsearch:9200`

ðŸ’¡ The Fleet server is installed and run as an Elastic agent. Fleet server and elastic agents can not run on the same system. This guide assume Fleet server will be installed on the ELK tenant.

### Step 1

Download the Elastic agent in the home folder, extract the contents.

`curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/elastic-agent/elastic-agent-7.17.23-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`

`tar -xvf elastic-agent-7.17.23-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`.

### Step 2

Navigate to Management âž¡ Fleet âž¡ Agent.

Walk through each of the steps, make sure to add the public IP address of your server / VPS.

ðŸ’¡ Use `http` for Fleet server.

### Step 3

Unzip: `tar -xvf elastic-agent-7.17.23-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`

### Step 4 

Make sure you are in the directory where the agent is installed. 

`cd ../elastic-agent-7.17.23-linux-x86_64`

Use the supplied install command with `http` as the fleet server, enrollment token, and `--insecure` to install the agent.

`sudo ./elastic-agent install --url=http://{public-ip-address}:8220 --enrollment token={token} --insecure`

Ensure `elastic-agent.service` is running.

`systemctl status elastic-agent.service`.
