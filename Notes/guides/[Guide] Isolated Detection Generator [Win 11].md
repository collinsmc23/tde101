# Install Windows 11 VM

A Windows 11 workstation with Atomic Red Team installed will simulate a "vulnerable user". By using Atomic Red Team, we can simulate various activity, which will generate logs. These logs can be used to write detection logic.

Use the following guide to provision a baseline Window 11 VM using VirtualBox. 

Choose Windows Enterprise Edition or Windows Pro for the best simulation of a business or enterprise workstation.

## Disable Windows Defender

In order to simulate malicious behavior without interruption, Windows Defender should be disabled. Windows Defender can be disabled through the Windows Security Settings, Group Policy Editor, and Command Line.

### Step 1 - Disable Powershell Script Prevention

Enter the following command, run Powershell as an Administrator.

`Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope CurrentUser`

Atomic Red Team is an open-source project designed to test detection and response capabilities. It provides a small library of self-contained test ("atomics") that map directly to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. 

By using a selection of tests (T Codes), you choose the specific adversary technique you want to simulate. The tests are provided through the command-line. After executing the tests, you can review the logs and alerts generated by your security tools.

#### Sample Execution of Test

`Invoke-AtomicTest T1003.001`
- T1003.001: Simulates lateral movement using the `lssase.exe` process and Mimikatz.

## Download
*For Windows Environments*

üí°
- Atomic Red Team comes bundled with the `Invoke-AtomicTest` powershell utility, which just installs the module. 
- The actual Atomic Tests are contained in the Atomics folder. Install the Atomics folder under the AtomicRedTeam folder for consistency.

### Step 1

Create new folder for AtomicRedTeam to be installed.
- ex. `C:\AtomicRedTeam\`

Exclude the file from Windows Defender AV scans.

`Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath C:\AtomicRedTeam\`

### Step 2

Install Atomic Red Team with "[Invoke AotmicRedTeam](https://github.com/redcanaryco/invoke-atomicredteam/wiki/Installing-Invoke-AtomicRedTeam)". 

Supply the command to install the Atomic Red Team module.

`Install-Module -Name invoke-atomicredteam,powershell-yaml -Scope CurrentUser`
- Download AtomicRedTeam Execution using PowerShell Gallery.

`IEX (IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/invoke-atomicredteam/master/install-atomicredteam.ps1' -UseBasicParsing);
- Download AtomicRedTeam Execution without using PowerShell Gallery.

`Install-AtomicRedTeam -getAtomics -Force`
- Install the execution framework.
- The Atomic folder (`-getAtomics`) where the test definitions are contained.
